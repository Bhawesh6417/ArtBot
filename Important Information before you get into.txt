Step 1: Update pubspec.yaml
Purpose:

To include the http package as a dependency in your project, which allows you to make HTTP requests.

Actions:

Open your pubspec.yaml file.
Add the http package under the dependencies section.
Save the file.
Run flutter pub get to fetch the dependencies.

Step 2: Create and Implement ai_generator.dart
Purpose:

To define a class that interacts with the OpenAI API to generate content based on a given prompt.

Actions:
Create a new Dart file named ai_generator.dart.
Import necessary packages (dart:convert for JSON handling and http for making HTTP requests).
Define the AIGenerator class with methods for generating content.

Step 3: Use the AIGenerator in Your Application
Purpose:
To integrate the AIGenerator class into your Flutter app, enabling you to generate content using the OpenAI API.

Actions:
Import ai_generator.dart into your main file.
Create an instance of AIGenerator.
Call the generateContent method when needed (e.g., in response to a button press).

Step 4: Handling API Keys Securely
Purpose:
To ensure that your API keys are not exposed publicly.

Actions:
Avoid hardcoding API keys directly in the code.
Use environment variables or secure storage solutions.
Summary
Update pubspec.yaml:

Add the http package.
Run flutter pub get.
Create ai_generator.dart:

Define the AIGenerator class.
Implement the generateContent method to call the OpenAI API.
Integrate the AI Generator:

Import and use the AIGenerator in your main application file.
Call the generateContent method when needed.
